            <h1>Cyber Bullying</h1>
            <p>Cyberbullying refers to the use of digital platforms (such as social media, texting, or online forums) to harass, intimidate, or harm someone. It can involve spreading harmful rumors, sending hurtful messages, sharing embarrassing photos or videos without consent, and more.

                Cyberbullying can have serious emotional, psychological, and even physical consequences for the victim. It can be particularly damaging because it's not confined to one space or time—it's persistent and can follow someone wherever they go, especially with smartphones and social media.
                
                Do you want to talk about how to deal with it, or are you looking for more information on its effects?

            <h1>Mental Health</h1>
            <p>Digital technology can significantly impact teens' mental health in both positive and negative ways. On one hand, it offers opportunities for social connection, self-expression, and access to helpful resources. However, excessive use, especially of social media, can lead to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem as teens compare themselves to idealized online images and feel pressure to maintain a perfect digital persona. Cyberbullying is another serious issue, causing emotional distress that can lead to feelings of isolation or even suicidal thoughts. Additionally, constant notifications and screen time can disrupt sleep and increase stress, further harming mental well-being. Overall, while digital technology can support teens, without balance and guidance, it can contribute to significant mental health challenges.  </p>
